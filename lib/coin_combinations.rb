  # Set the values for the seperate coins.

  # Set counters for each coin.

  # Run an until loop to each till the coin is higher then amount.
  # With the amount being subtracted by the coin amount.

  # With the penny use penny % (amount + 1) == 0
  # This checks to see if amount + 1 equals 0.
  # And when it does, get to the last part.

  # Then interpolate the coin counters into a string and return it.
